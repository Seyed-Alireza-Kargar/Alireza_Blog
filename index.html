        <h2>A Wonderful Day</h2>
        <p>
          Yesterday was a great day. In the morning, I went to work and
          completed all my tasks. I felt really productive. After work, in the
          evening, I went out with my friends. We walked around the city and
          enjoyed the cool evening breeze. Later, we decided to go to a
          restaurant, where we had a delicious dinner together. It was a perfect
          end to a busy but fun day!
